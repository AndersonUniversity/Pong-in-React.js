# Pong in React.js

This project implements the game of Pong using React.js

The Wikipedia page for Pong is here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong. It was
one of the earliest Arcade games, released in 1972.

# Future Features

- make the ball bounce off the paddles and change direction
- if the ball goes off the edge, the other player gets the point
- it would be nice to have a high-score board

# Buggy Aspects

- the paddles are not yet BOTH moving at the same time
- there is a warning message for GameArea.js in one of the useEffects
