# Pong in React.js

This project implements the game of Pong using React.js

The Wikipedia page for Pong is here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong. It was
one of the earliest Arcade games, released in 1972.

# Future Features

- add paddles to the game
- allow the players to control the movement of each paddle separately
- add the ball to the game and make it move
- make the ball bounce off the paddles and change direction
- if the ball goes off the edge, the other player gets the point
- it would be nice to have a high-score board
